      "Some kitties are perfectly content eating whichever cat food you decide to feed them, while others also try to steal food off of your plate whenever they can. And some pet owners don’t mind sharing a bit of what they’re eating with their feline companions. While this might be fine if you’re feeding your kitty a food that’s safe for him to eat, it’s important to know that there are several foods that are safe for humans but bad for cats.\nOne category of food that seems to get plenty of interest from cats is dairy products like milk and cheese.

It means Fluffy racing around the house in the wee hours while emitting a bone-chilling howl.\nFor my tiny tabby Shelby, it was like clockwork. The guttural, throaty call and the tap, tap, tap of busy claws on hardwood floors would begin at 3 am. By morning my bed was peppered with favorite soft toys that she had “killed” and brought to me throughout the night.\nThis manic behavior is not uncommon in cats and there can be a number of reasons your kitty feels the witching hour is the best time to cut loose and let off steam.",
